# final project - devin brown

DUE: November 28th 2011

## overview

Prepare an application to enter an emerging marketplace - "legal" marijuana sales. The goal of the application is simple, it helps facilitate the needs of potentially impaired users to obtain the items they "need." These items include marijuana, food, and a ride from a friend. Potential revenue could easily extracted from adds promoting particularly "delicious" food, or marijuana.

## functionality

- help people find the "things" they need
- things being:
  - marijuana (or liquor) stores
  - food locations (read: cheap drive-through)
- integration with your contacts
  - allow the user to call or message contacts

## services used

- GPS location
- retrieve information from the web (maps.google.com)
- integration with phone contacts
  - allow SMS notifications to be defined ahead of time
  - these notifications can then be dispatched in a "time of need"
- create text messages ahead of time and send later at will
  - requires persistent storage
  
## developmental priorities

1. access google maps
2. integrate GPS to show current location
3. search for snack shops, return results via maps
4. search for dispensaries, return results via maps
5. integrate contacts into app for easy access
6. utilize persistent storage to recall previously saved text messages
